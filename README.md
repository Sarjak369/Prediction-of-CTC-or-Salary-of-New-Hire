# Prediction-of-CTC-or-Salary-of-New-Hire

Hi everyone,
In this project, I have tried to perform Exploratory Data Analysis on the Employee Data which consists of several features like
S.No., College,	Role,	City, Previous CTC,	Previous job changes,	Graduation marks, etc. With the help of this, I have done data cleaning and
then performed the visualization techniques using Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries to get better understanding and insights about the data. 
Then we move forward to create Machine Learning models to predict the CTC or salary of New Hire based on the existing features we have. 
I have used scikit-learn library to create the models. The models which are used are Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor and Random Forest Regressor.
